-- State for Radar.lua. Jester-Radar is mostly a state machine.
-- Changes in the state will influence what he will execute in the next cycle.
-- For example, locking a target can be achieved by calling State.Reset() and setting a State.target_to_lock.
local State = {}

State.task = nil -- current task within the phase cycle, Jester only executes one task and then waits before proceeding
State.event_task = nil -- parallel task spawned via user actions like context-action, only one at a time. Use :SetEventTask.

State.current_phase = nil -- influences which phase is next to pick within the cycle, essentially the current state in the state-machine
State.is_active = nil -- whether Jester Radar is active or not. can be used externally to shut it off completely (for example when using the Pave Spike, see PrepareDscg.lua)
State.current_context_mode = Config.context_mode.A2A -- controlled by PrepareDscg.lua to tell the radar which context mode it is in, so it can interpret the action correctly

State.scan_screen_timer = s(0) -- how long Jester looked at the screen to interpret it (one of his phases), in order to proceed to the next phase eventually
State.current_scan_zone = nil -- table (name, range, altitude, is_relative) - influences which scan zone will be next, or Config.scan_zone.TARGET_FOCUS to scan a target instead

State.max_scan_time_for_zone_no_bandits = Config.MAX_ZONE_SCAN_TIME -- the max time to spend scanning the current zone; can be adjusted based on the situation to scan longer

State.pilot_requested_scan_zone = nil -- table (name, range, altitude, is_relative) - set to a zone if the user requested special attention at a given zone; will be scanned longer than normally
State.pilot_requested_range = Config.range.nm_50 -- the display range to use during a regular scan pattern, ignored when a target is under focus
State.pilot_requested_scan_type = Config.scan_type.wide -- the scan type to use during a regular scan pattern, ignored when a target is under focus
State.is_auto_focus_allowed = true -- whether Jester is allowed to auto-highlight and focus targets within threat range

State.target_to_highlight = nil -- if set, the given target will be highlighted, or "selected"; this also includes automatic cursor movement
State.pilot_requested_target_to_highlight = nil -- if set, Jester will stop automatically selecting high priority targets for highlight and stick to the selected target
State.target_to_focus_on = nil -- if set, the given target will be focused (must be set with State.target_to_highlight); aborts scan, points antenna at target, goes narrow view, adjusts display range
State.target_to_lock = nil -- if set, the given target will be locked (must be set with State.target_to_highlight and State.target_to_focus_on)
State.target_currently_locked = nil -- if set, Jester knows that a target is currently locked; controls if he will still attempt locking or instead hold the lock

State.last_iff_timestamp = s(0) -- timestamp the last IFF was executed, in order to not spam it

State.time_spent_trying_to_lock_bandit = s(0) -- in order to eventually give up if a bandit dropped from the screen
State.wrong_lock_attempts = 0 -- when Jester locks a contact but the lock is faulty, he will repeat and increase this counter; eventually he will abort

State.has_single_unidentified_contact = false -- whether, when spotted a new contact, it is only a single or multiple contacts; used to adjust the voice-flow

State.time_left_trying_to_lock_cage_target = s(0)

State.unidentified_new_targets = {} -- temporarily holds contacts just spotted but not yet identified, usually empty
